Track Widget Module - Individual Drum Track Interface

This module provides the track interface components for the MrBeat drum machine,
implementing individual drum track widgets with step sequencing capabilities.
Each track represents one drum sound with pattern programming functionality.

The track system enables users to create complex rhythmic patterns by combining
immediate sound triggering with step-based pattern sequencing. The visual
interface provides intuitive controls for both real-time performance and
detailed pattern programming.

Features:
- Individual sound triggering for real-time performance
- 16-step pattern sequencing with visual feedback
- Professional drum machine interface design
- Real-time pattern modification during playback
- Visual step grouping for easier pattern reading
- Seamless integration with audio engine and mixer

Architecture:
- TrackSoundButton: Immediate sound triggering
- TrackStepButton: Step-based pattern programming
- TrackWidget: Complete track with layout and logic integration

    Step sequencer button for pattern programming.
    
    This class represents an individual step in the drum pattern sequence.
    Each button can be toggled on/off to create rhythmic patterns, with
    visual feedback showing the current state.
    
    The button uses toggle behavior where:
    - "down" state = step is active (drum will trigger on this step)
    - "normal" state = step is inactive (silence on this step)
    
    Visual Design:
        Uses different background images for visual distinction between
        step groups (every 4 steps) to improve pattern readability.
    
    Inheritance:
        Inherits from Kivy's ToggleButton for built-in toggle functionality

        Automatically created by TrackWidget during track initialization.

    it immediately plays the associated audio sample through the audio engine.
    
    The button displays the name of the drum sound (e.g., "KICK", "SNARE")
    and provides visual feedback when pressed.
    
    Features:
        - Immediate audio sample triggering

    This class represents a complete drum track in the MrBeat interface,
    combining immediate sound triggering with step-based pattern programming.
    Each track manages one drum sound and provides comprehensive control
    over its playback behavior.
    
    The widget layout consists of:
    1. Sound trigger button with drum name
    2. Visual separator for clean layout organization  
    3. Series of step buttons for pattern programming (typically 16 steps)
    
    The track integrates with the audio engine to provide both immediate
    sound triggering and automated pattern playback through the sequencer.
